### üìù Project Summary & Purpose

In the competitive retail landscape, setting the optimal price for products is a critical challenge. Static pricing strategies often fail to adapt to market dynamics, leading to lost revenue and inefficient inventory management. This project tackles this problem by building a comprehensive, end-to-end analytics platform that provides data-driven answers to crucial business questions.

The core of this project is a robust **data pipeline** that ingests raw, relational sales data, cleans it using Python and Pandas, and structures it within a **local MySQL database**. This "Data Factory" then serves as the foundation for all subsequent analysis. Advanced machine learning models are used to perform **RFM customer segmentation**, **time-series demand forecasting**, and **price elasticity modeling**.

The final output is not just a report, but a suite of live, interactive tools. A **deployed Streamlit application** serves as the primary interface, allowing users to explore customer behavior, simulate the revenue impact of price changes, and receive AI-driven price recommendations. For high-level reporting, key insights are also aggregated and presented in a polished **Tableau dashboard** suitable for executive stakeholders.

### RFM Customer Segmentation Deep-Dive
Instead of just viewing customers as a monolith, the application uses RFM analysis and K-Means clustering to segment them into actionable groups like "Best Customers," "Loyal," and "At-Risk," complete with KPIs and behavioral summaries.
